I had to read a lot of books in graduate school.
Some were life-changing, and others were forgettable.

If I could bring a reading list back in time for my 'first year' graduate self, it would include the following:

### [Bayesian Data Analysis](https://www.crcpress.com/Bayesian-Data-Analysis-Third-Edition/Gelman-Carlin-Stern-Dunson-Vehtari-Rubin/9781439840955)

Third Edition, by Andrew Gelman, John B. Carlin, Hal S. Stern, David B. Dunson, Aki Vehtari, and Donald B. Rubin

Probably the most useful book I've ever owned.  

### [The Art of R Programming](https://www.nostarch.com/artofr.htm)

by Norman Matloff

![](/images/The-Art-of-R-Programming-Matloff-Norman.jpg){: .center-image}

This book made me less bad at programming in R.

### [Causality](http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521895606)

Second Edition, by Judea Pearl

![](/images/causality2-cover.jpg){: .center-image}

Ecology is complicated. We often lack replicated controlled experiments with random treatment assignment. This book helps with that.

### [Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP002348.html)

by Noel Cressie and Christopher Wikle

![](/images/spatiotemp.jpg){: .center-image}

A thoughtful treatment of hierarchical modeling in a spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal context. Has breadth with a healthy dose of outside references for depth.

### [Ecological Models and Data in R](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8709.html)

by Benjamin M. Bolker

![](/images/k8709.gif){: .center-image}

Covers fundamental ideas about likelihood and process-oriented modeling while building R proficiency.

### [Bayesian Models: A Statistical Primer for Ecologists](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10523.html)

by N. Thompson Hobbs & Mevin B. Hooten

![](/images/hobbs.gif){: .center-image}

An introduction to the process of model building and estimation for non-math/stats oriented readers.

### [Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/statistics-probability/statistical-theory-and-methods/data-analysis-using-regression-and-multilevelhierarchical-models)

by Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill

![](/images/cover.gif){: .center-image}

A gentle introduction to multilevel modeling, with plenty of graphics and integration with R.

### [Statistical Inference](http://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Inference-George-Casella/dp/0534243126)

Second Edition, by George Casella and Roger L. Berger

![](/images/casella.jpeg){: .center-image}

Essential for understanding the mathematical and probabilistic foundations of statistics. Read it after brushing up on calculus.

### [Linear Algebra](http://store.doverpublications.com/048663518x.html)
by George Shilov

![](/images/linalgebra.jpg){: .center-image}

I wish I had taken a class in linear algebra as an undergraduate, but I instead had to catch up in my first year of grad school. This book made it relatively painless.

### [Single and Multivariable Calculus](https://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/calculus_online/)
by David Guichard and friends

![](/images/guichardcalculus.jpg){: .center-image}

Because I took a few calculus classes in high school and college and didn't know why.

### [Mathematical Tools for Understanding Infectious Disease Dynamics](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9916.html)

by Odo Diekmann, Hans Heesterbeek & Tom Britton

![](/images/k9916.gif){: .center-image}

Mathematical epidemiology is a huge topic. This book introduces common models and approaches from first principles, with plenty of problems along the way to make sure you're following along. Read it with a notebook and pencil handy.
