Being in grad school, I do a lot of scholarly writing that requires associated or embedded R analyses, figures, and tables, plus bibliographies.

Microsoft Word makes this unnecessarily difficult.

Many tools are now available to break free from [the tyranny of Word](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html).
The ones I like involve writing an article in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format, integrating all data preparation, analysis, and outputs with the document (e.g. with the excellent and accessible [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package or with a custom `make` set up [like this one](https://github.com/mbjoseph/project-template)).
Add in version control with [Git](http://git-scm.com/), and you've got a nice stew going.

If you're involved in the open source/reproducible research blogo-twittersphere, this is probably old hat.
To many in my department, this looks like black magic.
It's not.

I can't give an authoritative overview, but here are some resources that helped me get through my divorce:

- [R Markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/authoring/using_markdown) = [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) + [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) may be one of the better places to start
