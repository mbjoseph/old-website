I'm a quantitative ecologist with broad interests, partly outlined below.
Many of my current projects involve the development of methods to better understand species interactions, distributions, and traits.

### Host-symbiont interactions

I'm generally interested in how host-symbiont interactions shape our world.
For instance, biodiversity loss can alter disease dynamics as hosts go extinct or change in abundance.
A challenge in contemporary disease ecology is to develop a predictive framework that can anticipate when and how biodiversity loss will alter disease.
Currently I am working with collaborators to integrate and synthesize research on parasite transmission and processes that drive extinction in biological communities with the goal of enhancing this predictive framework.

### Occupancy and abundance

Some of my current work involves the development of occupancy models that are nested within structural equation models, so that processes driving species occurrence can be more explicitly incorporated into statistical models that explain survey data.
We're currently evaluating the effects of cattle grazing on amphibian communities in the San Francisco Bay area, which include direct effects and indirect effects mediated through changes in vegetation and water chemistry.
In addition, I'm working with collaborators in the same region to develop joint host-symbiont models that account for nestedness of parasites within hosts, and subsequent correlations in occurrence.

### Amphibian declines

Amphibians face many threats worldwide, even in protected wilderness areas and national parks. My most recent amphibian conservation work has focused on tracking and explaining individual level patterns of chytrid (*Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis*) infection in wild frogs, with the goal of better understanding spatial and temporal determinants of disease status. Furthermore, this work provides insights into habitat use patterns, overwintering behavior, and metapopulation dynamics of local amphibians that can be used to inform management decisions.
