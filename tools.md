An R package for acquisition and processing of NASA SMAP soil moisture data 

This package came about after some colleagues and I used some of NASA's soil moisture active-passive data, and realized that our workflow could be conveniently wrapped up into a package. 
With smapr, you can programmatically search, download, and process soil moisture data without having to interface directly with the HDF5 storage format or somewhat rare projections involved in manual processing.

An R package for data acquisition from basketball-reference.com

This package is currently in development, but the idea is to make it easy to snag historical NBA data from basketball-reference.com.
