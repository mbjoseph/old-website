I'm a data scientist in the Analytics Hub at Earth Lab with interests in spatial analysis, occupancy modeling, machine learning, high performance computing, reproducible research, open science, and disease ecology.

You can find out more about my academic research on my [**pubs**](/pubs) page.
I also have a [**blog**](/blog) where you'll find a variety musings on quantitative topics, data visualization, and more.
I occasionally work on R packages, which you can find on the [**tools**](/tools) page.
